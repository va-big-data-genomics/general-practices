# Group Meetings

The VA Big Data Genomics group meets every week, via Zoom. The meeting is approximately one hour long with a five minute break in the middle. The first half of the meeting is for sharing and discussing relevant updates and is open to all members and collaborators. The second half is reserved for internal group discussion and is limited to core and auxiliary members.

## Meeting Structure
Because we are a fully remote team, this is the only opportunity we have discussions as a group.

### Open discussion
Beginning in 2023, we will try a new meeting structure. Instead of having one group member give a typical presentation in the first half of the meeting, they will provide a written summary of the work they've been doing, with links to relevant resources such as Jupyter notebooks, code commits, markdown documents, pull requests, or issues. The first 15 minutes or so of the meeting, everyone will take time to review report and think about ideas or questions they'd like to discuss in more detail. The next 15 minutes will be dedicated to discussion of the report.

### Internal discussion
The second half of the meeting is less structured and provides an opportunity for group members to discuss housekeeping issues, concerns, desires, problem solving strategies, gossip, and weird dreams.

## Goals of the new meeting structure
* **Reinforce the importance of documentation** Our most valuable asset is our members. Our second most valuable asset is their knowledge. Documentation is a way to store and share that knowledge with other members and collaborators. This new form of meeting is designed to meet that function.
* **Foster discussion** The greatest value of having a bunch of smart people in one place is being able to discuss and interrogate complex ideas, together. I'd rather focus the meeting towards that goal, than having one person monologue. And with a fully remote team, group meetings are the only time we are all together. I find it much more engaging and enjoyable to use that opportunity to talk with everyone.
* **More information sharing** By posting meeting updates online, people can read them even if they didn't attend the meeting. They can also refer back to them at a later date. This makes it much easier for a more people to stay up-to-date with the group.
* **Deeper discussion** With meeting resources online, people can continue conversations through tools like GitHub Issues, long after the meeting has ended. This could be useful for ongoing projects like data releases where discussions of issues can persist over the course of weeks or months. Rather than trying to rehash the state of the project at every meeting, members can refer to a persistent project resource.
* **Keep it tight** Everyone has something they would rather be doing than attending a meeting. And with members spread across the country, an afternoon meeting for west coasters is an evening meeting for east coasters. I appreciate everyone who contributes to the group by joining these meetings and want to be respectful of their time. To that end, I want them to be thoughtful and concise (and short).

## Membership
### Core members
Core members devote 100% of their efforts to the mission of the VA Big Data Genomics group. Core members are expected to contribute work summaries and lead the open discussion section once a month.

### Auxiliary members
Auxiliary members are essential to the group but do not make a full time commitment. They are expected to lead the open discussion once a quarter.

### Collaborators
Collaborators are stakeholders in data or methods related to the group and may lead the open discussion as appropriate.
