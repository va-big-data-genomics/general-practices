This is a [tutorial](run-telseq-in-docker-container.md) where you will learn to run containerized bioinformatics
software on a cloud virtual machine. We will be using the telomere software
`telseq`, as our example use case. Throughout the tutorial, you will see links
to more detailed explanations of how to do certain things; just click, follow
the directions, and go back one page to resume the tutorial.
